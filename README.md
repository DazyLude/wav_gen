## WAVGEN
This project is a binary application that parses a text file, which contains specified notes, to a .wav file that simulates these notes being played.
Or, simply said, a generator of .wav files.

# Examples
An example of a valid .wavg file is located in the examples folder.

# Supported sounds
Currently only a simple sinewave is supported, with frequency modification allowed.
