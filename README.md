## WAVGEN
This project is a source code for a binary application that parses a text file, which contains specific notes, to a .wav file that simulates these notes being played.

Or, simply said, a generator of .wav files.

# Examples
An example of a valid .wavg file is located in the examples folder.

To create a wav file from it, run the application with command line argument containing path to file, for example "wav_gen examples/example_melody.wavg"

# Supported sounds
Currently only a simple sinewave is supported, with frequency modification allowed.
